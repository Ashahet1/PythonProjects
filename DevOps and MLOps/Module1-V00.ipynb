  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "**1. How is MLOps different from traditional software engineering?**\n",
    "MLOps focuses on managing the full ML lifecycle—data, models, and deployment—whereas traditional software engineering mainly manages code and application logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. When would you choose a lightweight vs heavy MLOps system?**\n",
    "Lightweight for small projects or quick experiments; heavy for large, complex systems that need scalability, monitoring, and governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What cultural changes are needed to adopt MLOps practices?**\n",
    "Teams must embrace collaboration between data scientists, engineers, and operations, and adopt continuous improvement and automation mindsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. How could data poisoning threats impact an organization?**\n",
    "They can corrupt training data, leading to biased or malicious models that harm decision-making and trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Why is business alignment important for MLOps success?**\n",
    "Without business alignment, ML efforts risk producing models that don’t deliver real value or solve the right problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What data storage approach best meets your model training needs?**\n",
    "Choose based on data type and scale—structured data may suit relational databases, while large unstructured data needs object storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Which maturity level best describes your team's current MLOps state?**\n",
    "Depends on your practices—manual workflows = early stage, automated pipelines with monitoring = advanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. How could a centralized feature store help your model development process?**\n",
    "It standardizes features, reduces duplication, and ensures consistency between training and serving environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. What cultural changes are needed to implement CI/CD pipelines?**\n",
    "A shift toward automation, rapid iteration, and shared responsibility for code quality and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Which MLOps platform provider is best suited to your applications?**\n",
    "The one that matches your needs—AWS for scalability, GCP for AI tools, Azure for enterprise integration, or open-source for flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. What types of logic would work well packaged as a microservice?**\n",
    "Reusable, independent tasks like prediction APIs, data validation, or preprocessing pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. How could you improve the CI/CD pipeline example?**\n",
    "Add automated tests, monitoring, rollback strategies, and security checks to make it more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**13. What other pre-trained models could you deploy besides Hugging Face?**\n",
    "Models from TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub, or OpenAI APIs depending on your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**14. How else could App Runner or Flask apps be triggered besides HTTP?**\n",
    "Via event-driven triggers such as message queues, cron jobs, or cloud functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**15. Why is having a requirements.txt file important?**\n",
    "It ensures consistent dependencies across environments, making projects reproducible and easier to share.\n",

    "   * Central feature store.\n",
    "   * Automated training + deployment pipelines.\n",
    "   * Continuous monitoring for drift/performance.\n",
