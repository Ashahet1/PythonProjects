    "## Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When would you want to use a generator function instead of a normal function?\n",
    "You should choose a generator function when you need to produce a sequence of values, but you don't need all the values at once. Think of it as a \"lazy\" function. A normal function calculates and returns a single value (or a list of all values) all at once, which can be inefficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of a generator is memory efficiency. It yields one item at a time and \"pauses,\" saving its state. This means it doesn't have to hold the entire sequence in memory. This is especially important when dealing with very large or even infinite sequences of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are some real-world examples where a generator would be useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing large files: Imagine you have a multi-gigabyte log file and you want to process each line. A generator can read one line at a time and yield it, so you don't have to load the entire file into memory. This is a common and powerful use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data streams: When you're working with data that is continuously coming in, like from a real-time API or a sensor, a generator can process each new piece of data as it arrives without waiting for the whole stream to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating infinite sequences: You can use a generator to create a function that produces an infinite sequence, like the Fibonacci series. A normal function would run forever or crash because it can't store an infinite list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Game loops and simulations: In a simple game, a generator can be used to control the flow of the game, yielding the next state (e.g., the next turn or animation frame) only when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How do generators save state between executions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most powerful and unique feature of a generator. When a normal function calls return, it exits and all of its local variables are destroyed. A generator, on the other hand, uses the yield keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "When yield is encountered, the function pauses its execution, returns the yielded value, and saves its entire local state. This includes the values of all local variables and where it was in the code (the exact line). When you ask the generator for the next value, it resumes execution from the exact spot where it left off, with all of its variables intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What happens if you reach the end of a generator function?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a generator function runs out of items to yield (e.g., a for loop finishes or it hits a return statement), the generator is considered exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call next() on an exhausted generator, it will raise a StopIteration exception. This is how Python signals that the iteration is complete. When you use a for loop with a generator, the loop handles this exception automatically and knows when to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the main syntactic difference between a generator function and normal function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary and most important difference is the keyword used to return a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal functions use the return keyword. When return is executed, the function immediately exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generator functions use the yield keyword. When yield is executed, the function pauses and yields a value, but it does not exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the yield keyword, a function is automatically recognized as a generator. When you call a generator function, it doesn't execute the code inside it immediately; instead, it returns a special generator object that you can then iterate over.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this helps make the concepts of generators clear! Let me know if you'd like to see a specific code example for one of the real-world uses we discussed, like processing a large file.\n",
    "\n",
