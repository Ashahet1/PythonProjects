    "This self-paced 4.5 hour learning path from Microsoft Learn teaches Python programming basics for beginners. It covers fundamental concepts like variables, data types, strings, math operations, Booleans, lists, loops, dictionaries, functions, and error handling through short video modules with coding demos and challenges.\n",
